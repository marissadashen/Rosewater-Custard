# Rosewater-Custard
This dessert is one of my favorites. My step-father who is from Iran was the main cook in our household, and would make this refreshing dessert frequently.

 
¾ cup cornstarch

4 cups milk

1 cup sugar

Seeds of 5 cardamom pods

¼ cup rosewater

¼ cup finely chopped pistachios and rose petals for garnish
 

In a saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch in the milk and add the sugar.

Cook over medium heat for 5-10 minutes, stirring constantly until the mixture has thickened.   

Add the cardamom seeds and rosewater. Stirring constantly with a whisk to prevent sticking, for a few minutes longer until the mixture reaches the consistency of pudding. Remove the saucepan from the heat.

Transfer the custard to serving dishes. Garnish with the pistachio rose petal mixture, and chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour.
